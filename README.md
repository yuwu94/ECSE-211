ECSE-211 Design Principles and Methods
========

This is a semester long robotics course. 
The goal is to build an autonomous robot capable of localizing within a map, navigation to a certain location, picking up blocks, and bringing the blocks back to a certain location. The locations are given right before the competition.

This project was coded in Java. Please look at the DPM/src folder for all the java classes
